It's the first address in the range of IP addresses assigned to a network. To find the network address:\n\nGiven IP address: 10.42.37.12/22\n\nSubnet mask for /22: 255.255.252.0\n\nTo find the network address, you perform a bitwise AND operation between the IP address and the subnet mask:\n\n```\nIP Address:    10.42.37.12    ->  00001010.00101010.00100101.00001100\nSubnet Mask:   255.255.252.0  ->  11111111.11111111.11111100.00000000\n```\n\nPerforming the bitwise AND operation:\n\n```\nNetwork Address:   00001010.00101010.00100000.00000000  ->  10.42.36.0\n```\n\nSo, the network address is 10.42.36.0.\n\n### 2) Broadcasting Address:\n\nThe broadcasting address is the last address in the range of IP addresses assigned to a network. To find the broadcasting address:\n\nSince this is a /22 subnet, the subnet mask is 255.255.252.0.\n\nThe broadcasting address is calculated by setting all host bits in the IP address to 1:\n\n```\nNetwork Address:   00001010.00101010.00100000.00000000  ->  10.42.36.0\nSubnet Mask:       11111111.11111111.11111100.00000000\n```\n\nPerforming the bitwise NOT operation on the subnet mask:\n\n```\nBroadcasting Address:  00001010.00101010.00100111.11111111  ->  10.42.39.255\n```\n\nSo, the broadcasting address is 10.42.39.255.\n\n### 3) Number of Hosts:\n\nTo find the number of hosts in this network, we need to subtract two from the total number of addresses in the subnet. This is because one address is reserved for the network address and another for the broadcasting address.\n\nSince this is a /22 subnet, it has 2^(32-22) - 2 = 2^10 - 2 = 1024 - 2 = 1022 hosts.\n\nSo, this network can have 1022 hosts.\n\n\n## in summary:\n\nuse bitwies AND between the IP address and subnet mask to get the network address\n\nand then bitwise NOT between network address and subnet masking to get the broadcasting address","tags":[]}]
