[{"grab":"## Conditional Flag demonstration from Chatgpt","views":"Certainly! Understanding conditional flags in x86 assembly language can be a bit challenging, but I'll try to provide a clearer explanation with examples.\n\nIn x86 assembly, there are several conditional flags that represent the outcome of various operations. These flags are typically set based on the result of previous instructions and are used to make decisions or control program flow. The commonly used conditional flags include:\n\n1. **Zero Flag (ZF):** This flag is set (1) if the result of an operation is zero, and it's cleared (0) if the result is non-zero. It's often used in comparisons.\n\n2. **Sign Flag (SF):** The sign flag reflects the most significant bit of the result. If the result is negative, SF is set (1); if it's positive or zero, SF is cleared (0).\n\n3. **Overflow Flag (OF):** The overflow flag is set (1) if there is an arithmetic overflow, indicating that the result is too large or too small to be represented using the available number of bits.\n\n4. **Carry Flag (CF):** The carry flag is used for operations involving multiple-word numbers. It's set (1) if there's a carry-out or borrow into the most significant bit during arithmetic operations.\n\nNow, let's illustrate these flags with some examples:\n\n**Example 1: Comparisons**\n\nConsider the following x86 assembly code:\n\n```assembly\nmov eax, 5\ncmp eax, 7\n```\n\nIn this code, we load the value 5 into the `eax` register and then compare it to 7 using `cmp`. After the comparison, the flags are set as follows:\n\n- `ZF` (Zero Flag) is cleared because 5 is not equal to 7.\n- `SF` (Sign Flag) is cleared because 5 is positive.\n- `OF` (Overflow Flag) is cleared because there's no overflow in this comparison.\n- `CF` (Carry Flag) is cleared because it's not relevant in a simple comparison.\n\n**Example 2: Arithmetic Operations**\n\nNow, let's consider an addition operation:\n\n```assembly\nmov eax, 2147483647  ; Largest signed 32-bit integer\nadd eax, 1           ; Add 1 to it\n```\n\nIn this code, we add 1 to the largest signed 32-bit integer. After the addition, the flags are set as follows:\n\n- `ZF` (Zero Flag) is cleared because the result is not zero.\n- `SF` (Sign Flag) is set because the result is negative (due to overflow).\n- `OF` (Overflow Flag) is set because there's an overflow (result is too large for a signed 32-bit integer).\n- `CF` (Carry Flag) is set because there's a carry-out from the most significant bit.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how the conditional flags reflect the outcome of instructions and can be used to make decisions or control program flow in x86 assembly language. Depending on the values of these flags, you can use conditional jump instructions (e.g., `je`, `jg`, `jnz`, etc.) to execute different code paths.","tags":["systems"]},{"grab":"## Program counter (PC) relative addressing\n\njump encoding using Program counter: encode the difference between the address of the target instruction and the address of the instruction immediately following the jump\n\ne.g \n```assembly\n0:  48 89 f8   mov    %rdi,%rax\n3:  eb 03      jmp    8 <loop+0x8>\n5:  48 d1 f8   sar    %rax\n8:  48 85 c0   test   %rax,%rax\nb:  7f f8      jg     5 <loop+0x5>\nd:  f3 c3      repz retq\n```","views":"`03` is used to encode the position of the jump operand `8 <loop+0x8>` the 0x8 which is the position of the instruction to jump to is calculated using `03` and the address of the next instruction `0x5` hence `0x3 + 0x5 = 0x8`\n\nAlso same thing for the `<loop+0x5>`.  `0x5` is calculated using `0xf8` + `0xd` \n\nremember `0xf8` is `15 8` which is `1111 1000` in  `2's` compliment that will give us `-8`\n\nHence `0xf8 + oxd` = `-8 + 13 = 5`\n\n","tags":["systems"]}]
