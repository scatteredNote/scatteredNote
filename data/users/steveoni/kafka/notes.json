[{"grab":"## Producer configuration","views":"Certainly! Apache Kafka offers a wide range of producer configurations that allow you to fine-tune the behavior of your Kafka producer to meet your specific requirements. Here's a detailed explanation of some of the most commonly used producer configurations:\n\n1. **bootstrap.servers**:\n   - **Type**: String\n   - **Default**: None (must be specified)\n   - **Description**: This is a list of Kafka broker addresses that the producer will use to establish an initial connection. It should be in the format `host1:port1,host2:port2,...`. The producer will automatically discover other brokers from the metadata provided by the bootstrap brokers.\n\n2. **acks**:\n   - **Type**: String\n   - **Default**: \"1\"\n   - **Description**: This configuration controls the number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader broker to receive before considering a message as sent successfully.\n     - \"0\": No acknowledgments (messages can be lost).\n     - \"1\": Leader acknowledgment (default, ensures the message is written to the leader).\n     - \"all\" or \"-1\": Acknowledgment from all in-sync replicas (maximal durability).\n\n3. **retries**:\n   - **Type**: Integer\n   - **Default**: 0\n   - **Description**: The number of times the producer will retry sending a message upon encountering a transient failure. A non-zero value can help in ensuring message delivery in the face of network issues or broker unavailability.\n\n4. **linger.ms**:\n   - **Type**: Integer\n   - **Default**: 0\n   - **Description**: This setting introduces a small delay (in milliseconds) before sending a batch of messages. It can help increase batching efficiency and reduce the number of small, individual requests to Kafka brokers.\n\n5. **compression.type**:\n   - **Type**: String\n   - **Default**: \"none\"\n   - **Description**: This configuration specifies the compression codec to use for messages. Supported values include \"none,\" \"gzip,\" \"snappy,\" and \"lz4.\" Compression can reduce network bandwidth usage at the cost of CPU usage.\n\n6. **batch.size**:\n   - **Type**: Integer\n   - **Default**: 16384 (16KB)\n   - **Description**: The maximum size (in bytes) of a batch of messages that will be sent to a Kafka broker. Batching reduces the overhead of sending individual messages.\n\n7. **max.request.size**:\n   - **Type**: Integer\n   - **Default**: 1048576 (1MB)\n   - **Description**: This configuration sets the maximum size (in bytes) of an individual message. If a message exceeds this size, it will be rejected.\n\n8. **client.id**:\n   - **Type**: String\n   - **Default**: \"\"\n   - **Description**: An arbitrary string identifier for the producer. It is used in logging and can be helpful for monitoring and distinguishing different producer instances.\n\n9. **buffer.memory**:\n   - **Type**: Integer\n   - **Default**: 33554432 (32MB)\n   - **Description**: The amount of memory (in bytes) the producer uses to buffer messages before sending them to Kafka. You may need to adjust this value based on the volume of messages you produce.\n\n10. **max.in.flight.requests.per.connection**:\n    - **Type**: Integer\n    - **Default**: 5\n    - **Description**: The maximum number of unacknowledged requests the producer will send to a broker before blocking additional sends. Increasing this value can improve throughput, but it may also increase the risk of message reordering.\n\n11. **linger.ms**:\n    - **Type**: Integer\n    - **Default**: 0\n    - **Description**: This setting introduces a small delay (in milliseconds) before sending a batch of messages. It can help increase batching efficiency and reduce the number of small, individual requests to Kafka brokers.\n\n12. **key.serializer** and **value.serializer**:\n    - **Type**: String (class name)\n    - **Default**: \"org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer\"\n    - **Description**: These configurations specify the serializers for message keys and values. You can use built-in serializers or implement custom ones to serialize your data into bytes before sending it to Kafka.\n\nThese are just a few of the many producer configurations available in Kafka. The choice of configuration parameters depends on your specific use case, performance requirements, and reliability considerations. It's essential to carefully choose and test these configurations to optimize the behavior of your Kafka producer for your particular scenario.","tags":["kafka"]},{"grab":"example of producer configuration","views":"```py\nfrom confluent_kafka import Producer, KafkaError\n\n# Kafka broker address\nbroker = \"localhost:9092\"\n\n# Producer configuration\nproducer_config = {\n    'bootstrap.servers': broker,\n    'client.id': 'producer-demo',\n    'acks': 'all',           # Ensure message durability\n    'retries': 3,            # Retry on transient errors\n    'compression.type': 'gzip',  # Use compression for efficient data transfer\n    'batch.size': 16384,     # Control the batch size\n    'linger.ms': 10,         # Introduce a small delay for batching (10ms)\n    'max.request.size': 1048576,  # Control the maximum message size (1MB)\n}\n\n# Create a Kafka producer instance\nproducer = Producer(producer_config)\n\n# Kafka topic to produce messages to\ntopic = \"demo-topic\"\n\ntry:\n    # Produce messages\n    for i in range(10):\n        message = f\"Message {i}\"\n        producer.produce(topic, key=str(i), value=message)\n        print(f\"Produced: {message}\")\n\n    # Wait for any outstanding messages to be delivered and delivery reports received\n    producer.flush()\n\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n    pass\nfinally:\n    # Close the producer to release resources\n    producer.close()\n```","tags":["kafka"]},{"grab":"## Logstash config example","views":"```bash\ninput {\n  file {\n    path => \"/home/nginx.log\"\n    start_position => \"beginning\"\n    sincedb_path => \"/dev/null\"\n  }\n  kafka {\n    bootstrap_servers => \"localhost:9092\"  \n    topics => [\"nginx_logs\"]     \n  }\n}\n\nfilter {\n  json {\n    source => \"message\"\n  }\n  geoip {\n    source => \"remote_ip\"\n  }\n  useragent {\n    source => \"agent\"\n    target => \"useragent\"\n  }\n}\n\noutput {\n  elasticsearch {\n    hosts => [\"http://es:9200\"]\n    index => \"nginx\"\n  }\n  stdout {\n    codec => rubydebug\n   }\n}\n\n```","tags":["logstash","kafka"]}]
